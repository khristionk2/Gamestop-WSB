# Gamestop-WSB

* The purpose of this project is to understand the unprecedented behavior of stocks, particularly Gamestop (GME), during the early part of 2021. 
* Many people on the Reddit subreddit, Wallstreetbets, forced a short squeeze on the stock and urged many people to buy up the stock, and within days we seen the stock of GME jump from $17 to $500+
* I am seeking to understand what lead to this through an analysis, exploring  whether the comments and sentiments have a relationship with the volume and price of the stock
